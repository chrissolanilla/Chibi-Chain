#Chibi Chain, the Link Tree clone 
The purpose of this project was initally to get a better understanding of sveltekit and firebase.
Over the course of the developing this webapp, I have increasinlgy put in more and more of my flavor into making a truly unique and best of all free linktree alternative at https://chibichain.com
This website is hosted on netlify since firebase hosting was not able to work for me, however if you want to host this on firebase feel free to try. 
Below are the instructions for setting up the repo
# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
